I have been looking around here, and I have not found any resources of cameras that can be put in real time. (Don't put them in a config.lua) That's why I've decided to make this script free for everyone.

In the future, I will try to make it Standalone. But at the moment my knowledge does not leave ESX.

There are more than 10 languages to choose from. (Can be changed in config.lua) English, Spanish, Russian, Catalan, Polish, French, Finnish, German, Italian, Turkish, and Portuguese

I am going to try to have updates of this resource, since a lot of potential can be extracted from it. If you want to contribute something, you just have to tell me, or you can collaborate freely in the code.

Any error or bug let me know to rectify as soon as possible!
